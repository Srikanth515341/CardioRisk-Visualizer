This will explain your prototype clearly, which also covers the **Technical Documentation** requirement from the JD.

Here’s the **full and final code**:

# CardioRisk Visualizer (Frontend)

This is the **frontend prototype** of the CardioRisk Visualizer project.  
It is built using **React + TypeScript** and visualizes patient examination results with risk stratification based on cardiovascular guidelines.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Visualization of Patient Examination Results**
  - Displays patient details: age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, glucose.
  - Clean card layout for each patient.

- **Integration of Medical Knowledge from Guidelines**
  - Uses official cardiovascular thresholds for cholesterol, BP, BMI, and glucose.
  - Risk levels are automatically calculated by the backend and shown in the frontend.

- **Risk Stratification Models**
  - Patients are categorized as **Low / Medium / High risk**.
  - Risk reasons are displayed clearly under each patient.

- **Data Visualization**
  - **Cholesterol Chart** (bar chart per patient).
  - **Blood Pressure Chart** (line chart per patient).
  - **BMI Chart** (bar chart per patient).

- **Prototype Development**
  - Full working dashboard that fetches data from backend API.
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Go to the `client/` folder:
   ```bash
   cd client
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Make sure the backend server is running on:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 📌 Notes

* Backend provides the API at `/api/patients`.
* Frontend consumes this API to display data and visualizations.
* This prototype is aligned with the **Dassault Systèmes internship project requirements**.

✅ With this README:  
- Anyone (including interviewers) can understand and run your frontend easily.  
- It documents **features, tech stack, structure, and usage**.

👉 At this point, both **server + client** are fully coded, styled, and documented.  
Do you want me to now guide you on how to **run the full project (server + client together)** and test the complete flow?
